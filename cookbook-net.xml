  <title>Complex Network Configuration</title>

  <para>
    This chapter contains solutions for several non-trivial network
    configurations. The first section discusses the interoperation of
    &dcache; with firewalls and does not require any background
    knowledge about &dcache; other than what is given in the
    installation guide (<xref linkend="in"/>) and the first steps
    tutorial (<xref linkend="intouch"/>). The following sections will
    deal with more complex network topologies, e.g. private subnets.
    Even though not every case is covered, these cases might help
    solve other problems, as well. Intermediate knowledge about
    &dcache; is required.

  <section id="cb-net-firewall">
    <title>Firewall Configuration</title>

    <para>
      The components of a &dcache; instance may be distributed over
      several hosts (nodes). Some of these components are accessed
      from outside and consequently the firewall needs to be aware of
      that. We contemplate two communication types, the &dcache;
      internal communication and the interaction from &dcache; with
      clients.
    </para>

    <para>
      Since &dcache; is very flexible, most port numbers may be
      changed in the configuration.  The command <command>dcache
      ports</command> will provide you with a list of services and the
      ports they are using.

    <title>&gridftp; Connections via two or more Network Interfaces</title>
      
    <section role="NotInToc">
      <title>Description</title>
      <para>
	The host on which the &gridftp; door is running has several
	network interfaces and is supposed to accept client
	connections via all those interfaces. The interfaces might
	even belong to separate networks with no routing from one
	network to the other.
      </para>

      <para>
	As long as the data connection is opened by the &gridftp;
	server (passive FTP mode), there is no problem with having
	more than one interface. However, when the client opens the
	data connection (active FTP mode), the door (FTP server) has
	to supply it with the correct interface it should connect
	to. If this is the wrong interface, the client might not be
	able to connect to it, because there is no route or the
	connection might be inefficient.
      </para>

      <para>
        Also, since a &gridftp; server has to authenticate with an
        &x509; grid certificate and key, there needs to be a separate
        certificate and key pair for each name of the host or a
        certificate with alternative names. Since each network
        interface might have a different name, several certificates
        and keys are needed and the correct one has to be used, when
        authenticating via each of the interfaces.

    <title>&gridftp; with Pools in a Private Subnet</title>
    
    <section role="NotInToc">
      <title>Description</title>
      <para>
        If pool nodes of a dCache instance are connected to a
        secondary interface of the &gridftp; door, e.g. because they
        are in a private subnet, the &gridftp; door will still tell
        the pool to connect to its primary interface, which might be
        unreachable.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The reason for this is that the control communication between
        the door and the pool is done via the network of &tcp;
        connections which have been established at start-up. In the
        standard setup this communication is routed via the &dcache;
        domain. However, for the data transfer, the pool connects to
        the &gridftp; door. The IP address it connects to is sent by
        the &gridftp; door to the pool via the control
        connection. Since the &gridftp; door cannot find out which of
        its interfaces the pool should use, it normally sends the IP
        address of the primary interface.
