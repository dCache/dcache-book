      <para>
	The &dcache; Book is the guide for administrators of &dcache;
	systems. The first part describes the installation of a simple
	single-host &dcache; instance. The second part describes the
	components of &dcache; and in what ways they can be
	configured. This is the place for finding information about
	the role and functionality of components in &dcache; as needed
	by an administrator. The third part contains solutions for
	several problems and tasks which might occur during operating
	of a &dcache; system. Finally, the last two parts contain a
	glossary and a parameter and command reference.

    <title>Preface</title>

    <para>
      Welcome to the &dcache;. &dcache; is a distributed storage
      solution for storing huge amounts of data without a hard limit,
      used to provide storage in the petabyte range. Therefore it
      qualifies as the storage system supporting data intensive
      experiments.
    </para>

    <para>
      &dcache; is a joined effort between the Deutsches
      Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) in Hamburg, Nordic Data Grid
      Facility (NDGF based in Copenhagen), the Fermi National
      Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago with significant
      distributions and support from the University of California, San
      Diego, INFN, Bari as well as Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK
      and CERN in Geneva.
    </para>

    <para>
      &dcache; can use hierarchical storage management (e.g., hard
      disk and tape), provides mechanisms to automatically increase
      performance and balance loads, increase resilience and
      availability. It also supplies advanced control systems to
      manage data as well as data flows. Normal filesystem (btrfs,
      ext4, XFS, ZFS) is used to store data on storage nodes.
    </para>

    <para>
      There are several ways of accessing data stored in &dcache;:

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>&nfs; v4.1 (&chimera;)</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>&http; and &webdav; </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>&gridftp; (&gsiftp;)</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>xrootd</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>&srm; (versions 1.1 and 2.2) </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>&dcap; and &gsidcap; </para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
      &dcache; supports certificate based authentication through the
      Grid Security Infrastructure used in &gsiftp;, &gsidcap;
      transfer protocols and the &srm; management protocol.
      Certificate authentication is also available for &http; and
      &webdav;.
    </para>

    <para>
      &dcache; also supports fine-grain authorization with support for
      POSIX file permissions and &nfs;-style access control lists.
    </para>

    <para>
      Other features of &dcache; are:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Resilience and high availability can be implemented in different ways by having multiple replicas of the same files.</para></listitem>

    </para>

    <para>
      &dcache; / &srm; can transparently manage data distributed among
      dozens of disk storage nodes (sometimes distributed over several
      countries).  The system has shown to significantly improve the
      efficiency of connected tape storage systems, by caching, gather
      and flush and scheduled staging techniques.  Furthermore, it
      optimizes the throughput to and from data clients by dynamically
      replicating datasets on the detection of load hot spots. The
      system is tolerant against failures of its data servers, which
      allows administrators to deploy commodity disk storage
      components.
    </para>

    <para>
      Access to the data is provided by various standard
      protocols. Furthermore the software comes with an implementation
      of the Storage Resource Manager protocol (&srm;), which is an
      open standard for grid middleware to communicate with site
      specific storage fabrics.

        For a high performance Grid scenario the hardware requirements
        highly differ, which makes it impossible to provide such
        parameters here. However, if you wish to setup a
        &dcache;-based storage system, just let us know and we will
        help you with your system specifications. Just contact us:
