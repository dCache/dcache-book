  <title>Configuring the &serv-poolmngr;</title>

  <!--
  <para>(We assume a basic knowledge of the functionality and terminology of
  dCache. Pool, domain, cell, how to log into a cell, and execute
  commands)</para>
  -->

  <para>
    The heart of a &dcache; system is the &serv-poolmngr;. When a user
    performs an action on a file - reading or writing - a
    <firstterm>transfer request</firstterm> is sent to the &dcache;
    system. The &serv-poolmngr; then decides how to handle this
    request.
  </para>

  <para>
    If a file the user wishes to read resides on one of the
    storage-pools within the &dcache; system, it will be transferred
    from that pool to the user. If it resides on several pools, the
    file will be retrieved from one of the pools determined by a
    configurable load balancing policy. If all pools the file is
    stored on are busy, a new copy of the file on an idle pool will be
    created and this pool will answer the request.
  </para>

  <para>
    A new copy can either be created by a <firstterm>pool to pool
    transfer</firstterm> (<abbrev>p2p</abbrev>) or by fetching it from
    a connected <firstterm>tertiary storage system</firstterm>
    (sometimes called <abbrev>HSM</abbrev> - hierarchical storage
    manager). Fetching a file from a tertiary storage system is called
    <firstterm>staging</firstterm>. It is also performed if the file
    is not present on any of the pools in the &dcache; system. The pool
    manager has to decide on which pool the new copy will be
    created, i.e. staged or p2p-copied.
  </para>

  <para>
    The behaviour of the &serv-poolmngr; service is highly
    configurable. In order to exploit the full potential of the
    software it is essential to understand the mechanisms used and how
    they are configured. The &serv-poolmngr; service creates the
    &cell-poolmngr; cell, which is a unique cell in &dcache; and
    consists of several sub-modules: The important ones are the
    <firstterm>pool selection unit</firstterm>
    (<abbrev>&psu;</abbrev>) and the load balancing policy as defined
    by the <firstterm>partition manager</firstterm>
    (<abbrev>PM</abbrev>).
  </para>

  <para>
    The &serv-poolmngr; can be configured by either directly editing
    the file <filename>&path-odc-ed;/PoolManager.conf</filename>
    or via the <link linkend="intouch-admin">Admin
    Interface</link>. Changes made via the Admin Interface will be
    saved in the file
    <filename>&path-odc-ed;/PoolManager.conf</filename> by the
    <command>save</command> command. This file will be parsed,
    whenever the &dcache; starts up. It is a simple text file
    containing the corresponding Admin Interface commands. It can
    therefore also be edited before the system is started. It can also
    be loaded into a running system with the <command>reload</command>
    command.  In this chapter we will describe the commands allowed in
    this file.
<!-- TODO:
This needs to be explained in the section on the Admin Interface:
        The syntax of the commands for configuring the &psu; will be
	explained with the examples below. These commands can be
	issued within the &cell-poolmngr; to change the configuration
	while the system is running. The
	<command>save</command>-command can then be used to save the
	current configuration to the file
	<filename>&path-odc-ed;/PoolManager.conf</filename>.

  </para>


  <section id="cf-pm-psu">
    <title>The Pool Selection Mechanism</title>

    <para>
      The &psu; is responsible for finding the set of pools which can
      be used for a specific transfer-request. By telling the &psu;
      which pools are permitted for which type of transfer-request,
      the administrator of the &dcache; system can adjust the system
      to any kind of scenario: Separate organizations served by
      separate pools, special pools for writing the data to a tertiary
      storage system, pools in a DMZ which serves only a certain kind
      of data (e.g., for the grid). This section explains the
      mechanism employed by the &psu; and shows how to configure it
      with several examples.
    </para>

    <para>
      The &psu; generates a list of allowed storage-pools for each
      incoming transfer-request. The &psu; configuration described below
      tells the &psu; which combinations of transfer-request and
      storage-pool are allowed. Imagine a two-dimensional table with
      a row for each possible transfer-request and a column for each
      pool - each field in the table containing either
      <quote>yes</quote> or <quote>no</quote>. For an incoming
      transfer-request the &psu; will return a list of all pools with
      <quote>yes</quote> in the corresponding row.
    </para>

    <para>
      Instead of <quote>yes</quote> and <quote>no</quote> the table
      really contains a <firstterm>preference</firstterm> - a
      non-negative integer.  However, the &psu; configuration is easier
      to understand if this is ignored.
    </para>

    <para>
      Actually maintaining such a table in memory (and as user in a
      configuration file) would be quite inefficient, because there are
      many possibilities for the transfer-requests. Instead, the &psu;
      consults a set of rules in order to generate the list of allowed
      pools. Each such rule is called a <firstterm>link</firstterm>
      because it links a set of transfer-requests to a group of pools.
    </para>

    <section id='cf-pm-links'>
      <title>Links</title>
      <para>
	A link consists of a
	set of unit groups and a list of pools. If all the unit groups
	are matched, the pools belonging to the link are added to
	the list of allowable pools.

      <para>

       Each link contains one or more <firstterm>unit

      <section id='cf-pm-links-units'>
	<title>Types of Units</title>
	<para>
	  There are four types of units: network
	  (<literal>-net</literal>), protocol

	  (<literal>-dcache</literal>) units. Each type imposes a
	  condition on the IP address, the protocol, the storage class
	  and the cache class respectively.

	<para>
	  For each transfer at most one of each of the four unit types
	  will match.  If more than one unit of the same type could
	  match the request then the most restrictive unit matches.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The unit that matches is selected from all units defined in
	  &dcache;, not just those for a particular unit group.  This
	  means that, if a unit group has a unit that could match a
	  request but this request also matches a more restrictive
	  unit defined elsewhere then the less restrictive unit will
	  not match.

	The conditions for the <emphasis>type of transfer</emphasis>

	attributes <literal>-readpref</literal>,
	<literal>-writepref</literal>,
	<literal>-p2ppref</literal> and
	<literal>-cachepref</literal>, which specify a
	preference value for the respective types of transfer. If all
	the unit groups in the link are matched, the corresponding
	preference is assigned to each pool the link points to. Since
	we are ignoring different preference values at the moment, a
	preference of <literal>0</literal> stands for
	<literal>no</literal> and a non-zero preference stands for
	<literal>yes</literal>. A negative value for <literal>-p2ppref</literal> means, that the value for <literal>-p2ppref</literal> should equal the one for the <literal>-readpref</literal>.

	<title>Multiple non-zero Preference Values</title>

	<note>
	  <para>
	    This explanation of the preference values can be skipped
	    at first reading. It will not be relevant, if all non-zero
	    preference values are the same. If you want to try
	    configuring the pool manager right now without bothering
	    about the preferences, you should only use
	    <literal>0</literal> (for <literal>no</literal>) and, say,
	    <literal>10</literal> (for <literal>yes</literal>) as
	    preferences. You can choose <literal>-p2ppref=-1</literal> if it should match the value for <literal>-readpref</literal>. The first examples below are of this type.
	  </para>
	</note>

	<para>
	  If several different non-zero preference values are used,
	  the &psu; will not generate a single list but a set of
	  lists, each containing pools with the same preference. The
	  Pool Manager will use the list of pools with highest
	  preference and select a pool according to the load balancing
	  policy for the transfer. Only if all pools with the highest
	  preference are offline, the next list will be considered by
	  the Pool Manager. This can be used to configure a set of
	  fall-back pools which are used if none of the other pools
	  are available.

	<title>Separate Write and Read Pools</title>

	<para>
	  The &dcache; we are going to configure receives data from a
	  running experiment, stores the data onto a tertiary storage
	  system, and serves as a read cache for users who want to
	  analyze the data.  While the new data from the experiment
	  should be stored on highly reliable and therefore expensive
	  systems, the cache functionality may be provided by
	  inexpensive hardware. It is therefore desirable to have a
	  set of pools dedicated for writing the new data and a
	  separate set for reading.
	</para>

	<informalexample>
	  <para>
	    The simplest configuration for such a setup would consist
	    of two links <quote>write-link</quote> and

        <para>
	  Why is the unit group <literal>allnet-cond</literal>

        <title>Reserving Pools for Storage and Cache Classes</title>

        <para>
	  If pools are financed by one experimental group, they
	  probably do not like it if they are also used by another
	  group. The best way to restrict data belonging to one
	  experiment to a set of pools is with the help of storage
	  class conditions. If more flexibility is needed, cache class
	  conditions can be used for the same purpose.
	</para>

	<informalexample>
	  <para>
	    Assume, data of experiment A obtained in 2010 is written
	    into subdirectories in the namespace tree which are tagged
	    with the storage class
	    <literal>exp-a:run2010@osm</literal>, and
	    similarly for the other years. (How this is done is
	    described in <xref linkend="secStorageClass" />.)
	    Experiment B uses the storage class
	    <literal>exp-b:alldata@osm</literal> for

          <para>
	    Note again that these will only be used, if none of the

	    <literal>exp-a:run2010@osm</literal>, or
	    <literal>exp-b:alldata@osm</literal>. If the administrator

  <section id="cf-pm-pm">
    <title>The Partition Manager</title>

    <para>The partition manager defines one or more load balancing
    policies. Whereas the &psu; produces a prioritized set of
    candidate pools using a collection of rules defined by the
    administrator, the load balancing policy determines the specific
    pool to use. It is also the load balancing policy that determines
    when to fall back to lesser prirority links, or when to trigger
    creation of additional copies of a file.</para>

    <para>Since the load balancing policy and parameters are defined
    per partition, understanding the partition manager is essential to
    tuning load balancing. This does not imply that one has to
    partition the &dcache; instance. It is perfectly valid to use a
    single partition for the complete instance.</para>

    <para>This section documents the use of the partition manager, how
    to create partitions, set parameters and how to associate links
    with partitions. In the following sections the available partition
    types and their configuration parameters are described.</para>

    <section id="cf-pm-pm-overview">
        <title>Overview</title>

        <para>There are various parameters that affect the load
        balancing policy. Some of them are generic and apply to any
        load balancing policy, but many are specific to a particular
        policy. To avoid limiting the complete &dcache; instance to a
        single configuration, the choice of load balancing policy and
        the various parameters apply to
        <firstterm>partitions</firstterm> of the instance. The load
        balancing algorithm and the available parameters is determined
        by the <firstterm>partition type</firstterm>.</para>

        <para>Each &psu; link can be associated with a different
        partion and the policy and parameters of that partition will
        be used to choose a pool from the set of candidate pools. The
        only partition that exists without being explicitly created is
        the partition called <literal>default</literal>. This
        partition is used by all links that do not explicitly identify
        a partition. Other partitions can be created or modified as
        needed.</para>

        <para>The <literal>default</literal> partition has a
        hard-coded partition type called
        <literal>classic</literal>. This type implements the one load
        balancing policy that was available in &dcache; before version
        2.0. The <literal>classic</literal> partition type is
        described later. Other partitions have one of a number of
        available types.  The system is pluggable, meaning that third
        party plugins can be loaded at runtime and add additional
        partition types, thus providing the ultimate control over load
        balancing in &dcache;. Documentation on how to develop plugins
        is beyond the scope of this chapter.</para>

        <para>To ease the management of partition parameters, a common
        set of shared parameters can be defined outside all
        partitions. Any parameter not explicitly set on a partition
        inherits the value from the common set. If not defined in the
        common set, a default value determined by the partition type
        is used. Currently, the common set of parameters happens to be
        the same as the parameters of the <literal>default</literal>
        partition, however this is only due to compatibility
        constraints and may change in future versions.</para>

        <para>A partition, so far, is just a set of parameters which
        may or may not differ from the default set. To let a partition
        relate to a part of the &dcache;, links are used.  Each link
        may be assigned to exactly one partition. If not set, or the
        assigned partition doesn't exist, the link defaults to the
        <literal>default</literal> partition.</para>

        <warning>
            <para>Depending on the way links are setup it may very
            well happen that more than just one link is triggered for
            a particular &dcache; request. This is not illegal but
            leads to an ambiguity in selecting an appropriate &dcache;
            partition. If only one of the selected links has a
            partition assigned, this partition is chosen.  Otherwise,
            if different links point to different partitions, the
            result is indeterminate.  This issue is not yet solved and
            we recommend to clean up the &serv-poolmngr; configuration
            to eliminate links with the same preferences for the same
            type of requests.

      <para>The <literal>classic</literal> partition type implements
      the load balancing policy known from &dcache; releases before
      version 2.0. This partition type is still the default. This
      section describes this load balancing policy and the available
      configuration parameters.</para>

      <informalexample>
          <para>To create a classic partition use the command:

      <section id="cf-pm-classic-policy">
          <title>Load Balancing Policy</title>

          <para>From the allowable pools as determined by the
          <glossterm linkend="gl-pm-comp-psu">pool selection
          unit</glossterm>, the pool manager determines the pool used
          for storing or reading a file by calculating a <glossterm
          linkend="gl-cost">cost</glossterm> value for each pool. The
          pool with the lowest cost is used.</para>

          <para>If a client requests to read a file which is stored on
          more than one allowable pool, the <glossterm
          linkend="gl-performance_cost">performance costs</glossterm>
          are calculated for these pools. In short, this cost value
          describes how much the pool is currently occupied with
          transfers.</para>

          <para>If a pool has to be selected for storing a file, which
          is either written by a client or <glossterm
          linkend="gl-restore">restored</glossterm> from a <glossterm
          linkend="gl-tape_backend">tape backend</glossterm>, this
          performance cost is combined with a <glossterm
          linkend="gl-space_cost">space cost</glossterm> value to a
          <glossterm linkend="gl-cost">total cost</glossterm> value
          for the decision. The space cost describes how much it
          <quote>hurts</quote> to free space on the pool for the file.
          </para>

          <para>The <glossterm linkend="gl-pm-comp-cm">cost
          module</glossterm> is responsible for calculating the cost
          values for all pools.  The pools regularly send all
          necessary information about space usage and request queue
          lengths to the cost module.  It can be regarded as a cache
          for all this information.  This way it is not necessary to
          send <quote>get cost</quote> requests to the pools for each
          client request. The cost module interpolates the expected
          costs until a new precise information package is coming from
          the pools.  This mechanism prevents clumping of requests.
          </para>

          <para>Calculating the cost for a data transfer is done in
          two steps. First, the cost module merges all information
          about space and transfer queues of the pools to calculate
          the performance and space costs separately.  Second, in the
          case of a write or stage request, these two numbers are
          merged to build the total cost for each pool. The first step
          is isolated within a separate loadable class. The second
          step is done by the partition.

          <title>The Performance Cost</title>

          <para>
              The load of a pool is determined by comparing the

              <glossterm>transfers</glossterm> to the maximum number
              of concurrent transfers allowed.

          <para>
              perfCost(per Type) = ( activeTransfers + waitingTransfers ) / maxAllowed .
          </para>

          <para>
              The maximum number of concurrent transfers
              (<symbol>maxAllowed</symbol>) can be configured with the commands
              <xref linkend="cmd-st_set_max_active"/> (store),

          </para>


          <para>
              Then the average is taken for each mover type where

              where store, restore and client transfers are allowed,

          <para>
              For a well balanced system, the performance cost should not exceed 1.0.

                              file has to be removed. If, on the other

                   NOCLUE
                   </para> -->

              <para>
                  As the last version of the formula suggests, a
                  pool can be in two states: Either <phrase
                  role="math">freeSpace &gt; gapPara</phrase> or
                  <phrase role="math">freeSpace &lt;=
                  gapPara</phrase> - either there is free space left
                  to store files without deleting cached files or
                  there isn't.
              </para>

              <para>
                  Therefore, <varname>gapPara</varname> should be
                  around the size of the smallest files which
                  frequently might be written to the pool. If files
                  smaller than <varname>gapPara</varname> appear
                  very seldom or never, the pool might get stuck in
                  the first of the two cases with a high cost.
              </para>

              <para>
                  If the LRU file is smaller than the new file,
                  other files might have to be deleted. If these are
                  much younger than the LRU file, this space cost
                  calculation scheme might not lead to a selection
                  of the optimal pool. However, in pratice this
                  happens very seldomly and this scheme turns out to
                  be very efficient.
